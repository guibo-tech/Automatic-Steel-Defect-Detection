# Automatic-Steel-Defect-Detection

Automatic identification of waviness defects in hot-rolled steel sheets using artificial neural networks and image processing techniques.

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Bachelor's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering thesis**.

- **Title**: Identification of Waviness Defects in Hot-Rolled Steel Sheets in a Steel Mill Using Artificial Neural Networks and Image Processing
- **Author**: Guilherme Lopes Borges

The project focuses on the **automatic identification of waviness defects** in hot-rolled steel sheets using an image-based system to contribute to **industry digitalization** by automating defect detection processes.

## Methodology
The system uses **artificial neural networks (ANNs)** and **computer vision** methodologies to detect and classify defects in real-time. The **image-based approach** automates manual inspection, reducing labor costs and increasing the speed and accuracy of defect identification.

## Key Features:
- **Image Processing**: Techniques like filtering, edge detection, and thresholding to preprocess the steel sheet images.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: A trained model classifies steel sheets as 'Defective' or 'Non-Defective'.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capable of processing images in real-time to identify defects as the sheets pass through the inspection system.

## Goals:
- Improve the speed and accuracy of detecting defects in steel production.
- Support the digitalization of industrial processes through automation.
- Reduce manual labor in quality control, minimizing the risk of human error.
